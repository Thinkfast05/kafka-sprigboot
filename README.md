Using springboot, I've created a REST Api endpoint that accepts a JSON object representing a person.
This object is published to a Kafka topic via a Kafka producer.

Person JSON Object:

The REST API endpoint accepts a JSON object in the following format:
{
  "id": "uniqueIdentifier",
  "name": "PersonName",
  "age": PersonAge
}
The id field is a unique identifier for the person.
The name field represents the person's name.
The age field represents the person's age as an integer.

REST API Endpoint:

Implemented a POST endpoint at /api/person that accepts the person JSON object.
Validated the JSON object to ensure all fields are present and age is a positive integer.
On receiving the valid JSON, extracted the data and forwarded it to a Kafka topic.

Kafka Producer:

The Kafka producer is configured to serialize the JSON data for transmission to a Kafka topic named person-topic.
Ensured the producer correctly handles serialization to preserve the JSON format within the Kafka message.

Logging:

Logged the receipt of a valid person object and its publication to Kafka, including any relevant identifiers.
